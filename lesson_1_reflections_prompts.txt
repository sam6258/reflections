How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	I was able to only look at the lines that had changed, so the comparison was very small.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	You can revert to different files whenever you need to.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	Every commit makes sense, but is left up to human decision.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	It allows us to apply a logical change for the entire project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Log to look for version and diff to look for changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	You can always revert back.
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	Android development.
